**Update: 2021-08-12**

Core C++ is fast approaching as we continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 cases in Israel.  
As per the Israeli Ministry of Health's guidelines, at this time there is nothing preventing having the conference as planned, if managed according to the [Green Pass requirements](https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/green-pass-info/).  

Please remember to wear a mask and obtain the Green Pass permit on time and present it – printed or digitally on a mobile – combined with your ID at the entrance.   

People who are not vaccinated and not defined as recovered by the Ministry of Health, are required to present a negative result of a rapid COVID-19 test, taken within 24 hours before arrival at the conference. In addition, they will be required to present a new negative test result on the 2nd day of the conference.

In addition, in order to ensure the safety of the participants and align with the standard in the industry, Core C++ will operate a rapid COVID-19 testing station, intended for all attendees, including the vaccinated.   
The test will prolong the reception and registration process by a few of minutes so we ask you to take that into account, and make an effort to arrive earlier. The coffee and the desserts will be ready! 

The testing station will remain open until 9:30 AM on the first day of the conference. 
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation!

An attendee with a positive COVID19 rapid test result will not be admitted and shall be reimbursed the price of their ticket. 


We will be updating this post as the situation develops.
