  title: "Bjarne Stroustrup - Thriving in a crowded and changing world: C++ 2006-2020"
  desrciptioin: "<p>By 2006, C++ had been in widespread industrial use for 20 years. It contained parts
                that had survived unchanged since introduced into C in the early 1970s as well as features that were novel in the early 2000s.
                From 2006 to 2020, the C++ developer community grew from about 3 million to about 4.5 million.
                It was a period where new programming models emerged, hardware architectures evolved, new application domains gained massive importance,
                and quite a few well-financed and professionally-marketed languages fought for dominance. How did C++ -- an older language
                without serious commercial backing -- manage to thrive in the face of all that? This paper focuses on the major language
                changes to the ISO C++ standard for the 2011 and 2020 revisions.</p>
                <p>Themes include efforts to preserve the essence of C++ through evolutionary changes, to simplify its use, to achieve 
                complete type-and-resource safety, to improve support for generic programming, to better support compile-time programming,
                to extend support for concurrency and parallel programming, and to maintain stable support for decadesâ€™ old code.</p>
                <p>The ISO C++ standard evolves through a consensus process. We try (not always successfully) to mitigate the effects
                of design by committee, bureaucratic paralysis, and excessive enthusiasm for a variety of language fashions.</p>
                <p>The talk will be given live online, followed by a live Q&A session.</p>"
